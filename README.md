# MOTOR Tutorial Repository

This repository is the tutorial repository for MOTOR. 

This is designed for use with the motor-t-base model uploaded on HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/StanfordShahLab/motor-t-base

https://github.com/som-shahlab/motor_tutorial/blob/main/MOTOR_Tutorial_Notebook.ipynb is our primary tutorial notebook, illustrating how to generate embeddings with MOTOR, and then train logistic regression models on top of those embeddings.
